# Development Rules for lig

`lig` means **Life is Graph**. Build a native Rust application with Iced.

## Essential requirements

- Maintain macOS, Windows, and Linux support.
- Organize code by layers. Follow [architecture rules](docs/rules/architecture.md).
- Preserve the graphics priorities in [platform rules](docs/rules/platforms.md).
- Keep the glass background opaque.
- Keep tests in separate files under `tests/`.
- Add meaningful tests for behavior changes and regression tests for bug fixes.
- Run `make check` and `make build` after all edits and before completion, commits, or pushes.
- Fix failed checks. Do not weaken tests or skip checks.
- Use Make, Cargo, and dprint. Do not introduce Node.js or npm.
- Keep documentation current in the same change.
- Keep technical details out of the interface. Follow [user-facing content rules](docs/rules/user-facing-content.md).
- Store every application text in i18n catalogs. Maintain English, Russian, and Spanish translations
  together.
- Write documentation and comments in English first. Use Russian as a secondary language when
  useful.
- Apply the five writing rules in [documentation rules](docs/rules/documentation.md) to prose.
- Do not add unsafe code.

## Read before working

The files below contain mandatory project rules. Open the required files explicitly before starting
relevant work. Do not treat links as loaded instructions. Read each applicable file once, then
reread it when its contents change. All rule files apply from the repository root. Read paths inside
them as repository-relative unless a link specifies otherwise.

Always read:

- [Development workflow](docs/rules/workflow.md)
- [Rust quality, separate tests, and checks](docs/rules/quality.md)
- [Supported platforms and graphics priorities](docs/rules/platforms.md)
- [Documentation and writing](docs/rules/documentation.md)
- [User-facing content](docs/rules/user-facing-content.md)

Read additional rules for the task:

| Task                                                      | Required rules                                     |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Change code, modules, dependencies, or architecture       | [Architecture](docs/rules/architecture.md)         |
| Change Iced state, messages, views, styling, or animation | [Iced and interface design](docs/rules/iced-ui.md) |
| Add or change application text or language behavior       | [Internationalization](docs/rules/i18n.md)         |
| Work on graph visualization, editing, audio, or AI        | [Subsystem rules](docs/rules/subsystems.md)   |

Read [the current architecture](docs/architecture.md) and affected feature documents before
implementation. Subsystem rules guide future development within the layers. Do not create empty modules.

## Maintain the rules

Keep this file short. Store detailed requirements in `docs/rules/`. Update this reading guide when
adding, moving, or removing a rule file. Keep each detailed rule in one authoritative file. Keep
summaries consistent with that file.
